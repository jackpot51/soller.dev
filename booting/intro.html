		<h1>Booting: Introduction</h1>

			How modern computers get from the power button to your desktop.

Computers are complicated machines, that themselves consist of many smaller
machines. It would take many years to understand the operations of just one such
component. This blog will attempt to explain the boot process from the point of
view of the firmware and software, and will abstract some parts of the boot
process for the purpose of simplicity. Bear in mind, that this simplification
will still not make things <em>simple</em>.
</p>
<p>
Also, there is considerable variability among computers, their firmware, and the
software that they run. In the past that has meant that the boot process could
vary wildly, though it would usually have some common concepts. For modern
computers and operating systems, the boot process generally uses
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Extensible_Firmware_Interface">Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI)</a>
and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Configuration_and_Power_Interface">Advanced Configuration and Power Interface (ACPI)</a>,
so this is what we will discuss.
</p>
<p>
With those stipulations out of the way, I'd like to first introduce the concept
of booting from a high level perspective. A user presses the power button on a
computer, the computer does something, a login screen is shown, the user logs
in, and they can now continue doing whatever they planned to do with the
computer. To most users, the whole process of booting - whatever time the
computer takes to prepare itself to be useful - seems as innocuous as it seems
vestigial. On the one hand, there is little reason for most users to care about
something that happens so rarely. On the other hand, it seems with such powerful
systems that they really ought to just boot straight to the desktop. What is so
important that the computer spends <em>billions</em> of cycles on it, while the
user waits?
</p>
<p>
It would be careless to say those cycles are not wasted. For sure, many of them
are. But the truth about the boot process, is that our computer hardware has
become so wildly complicated, running at the very edge of known physics, while
at the same time computer firmware (and software) has absorbed as much code as
programmers could fit into whatever storage holds it. This has led to boot times
increasing over time, rather than decreasing, even if it should be possible to
do the opposite.
</p>
<p>
It would also not be nice to say firmware developers do not care about boot
speed. Many of them do. But the environment that we operate in is one where the
performance of components at runtime is vastly more important than their
performance during boot. Additionally, there is a desire to push out hardware as
soon as possible, bugs in firmware are often tolerated if they do not affect the
runtime experience. For example, the firmware having to initialize something
multiple times is a clear "bug", but in the firmware world it may be seen as a
"feature" if it works around some issue and lets hardware ship sooner.
</p>
<p>
Back to the point, we can guess the computer is doing something in that time,
though it could probably do it better. We can guess that after the power button
is pressed, a piece of code called "firmware" initializes some things, reads
"software" from a storage device, and then transfers control to it. That
software, the operating system, then has support for all the hardware on the
computer, and abstracts it for other software to utilize. It is often not
realized that the firmware, in many ways, resembles an operating system. It is
composed of software, and has drivers for a wide set of hardware. The only real
difference, then, is where it is stored.
